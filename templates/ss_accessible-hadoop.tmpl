Abuse report: Accessible Hadoop servers in your network 
Dear Abuse teams,
 
 CIRCL is the CERT/CSIRT (Computer Emergency Response Team/Computer Security Incident Response Team) for the private sector, communes and non-governmental entities in Luxembourg.
 
 We have been informed by a trusted source that at the time of writing the following list of IP(s) appear to be publicly accessible Hadoop server. 

  $details

 Machines have either the NameNode or DataNode web interfaces running and accessible to the world on the Internet. At a minimum, this can allow for information gathering against the target organization. In other instances, it may allow a miscreant to manipulate the Hadoop instance.

 What are possible solutions?
 
 (1) Disable the service if not needed

 (2) Implement access lists to restrict access to this service

 
 Don't hesitate to get back to us if you have further questions or need additional support or want to inform us about false positives.
 
 We would appreciate if you confirm the reception of this report.
