 We have been informed by a trusted source that at the time of writing the following list of IP(s) appear to be publicly accessible Redis servers. As Redis has no authentication implemented, anyone has access to the key-value store.

 This service does not require authentication or authorization and could allow an entity to obtain a copy of the database.

 What are possible solutions?
 
 (1) Disable the service if not needed

 (2) Implement access lists to restrict access to this service

 
 Don't hesitate to get back to us if you have further questions or need additional support or want to inform us about false positives.
